- [ ] Check database user has minimal required permissions

### 3. Application Security
- [ ] Verify HTTPS is enforced (SSL certificate installed)

## ?? Critical Security Notes

### Default Admin Credentials (CHANGE IMMEDIATELY!)
```

Password: admin123
```

### Connection Strings
- Development: Uses local SQL Server Express
- Production: Must be updated with hosting provider details

### File Permissions
- Ensure write permissions only where necessary
- Protect configuration files from public access

## ?? Emergency Contacts
If you encounter security issues:
1. Contact your hosting provider immediately
2. Change admin passwords
3. Review access logs for suspicious activity

## ?? Password Security Best Practices
- Use a password manager
- Enable two-factor authentication if available
- Never share admin credentials
- Regularly update passwords (every 3-6 months)

## ?? Security Monitoring
After deployment, regularly check:
- Failed login attempts
- Unusual traffic patterns
- Database access logs
- File modification timestamps
